        I started in my 2nd university year selling desktop and database projects to other colleagues using .Net technologies. Through that I managed to gain good experience in desktop development. This helped me to work as a remote WPF developer for a company in Iraq. After developing many small to mid-level management applications I wanted to try new things so I took an offer as a freelancer backend developer using Asp.net core. I started with the project but there was no team leader that was qualified to lead the project. This lead to me being assigned to lead the team as I was the most experienced between the developing team. Leading the team gave me a lot of experience in planning sprints and interacting with other teammates. After that I moved to .Net developing and acted as a team leader (remote) for a company in Czech Republic. We worked on task based contracts for other companies.

        Along the way I developed a simulator for a subject in my University called parallel processors. The project simulated how the processors execute instructions in assembly. I also started my YOUTUBE channel and kept on selling programs. I also developed a CNN network for classification that took the base of ResNet blocks but in a shallow network so we can drop the memory used to store the weights without much accuracy drop.
        Currently I am working on developing new skills in AI, and .Net development.
