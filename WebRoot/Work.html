    <!--Goal-->
    <p><span class="c1">Duties: </span>
        Worked on Task based projects. My role was mostly as a .Net developer using WPF, ASP.Net and also leading the team of 4.<br/>
         We would take on mini to mid tasks with some companies in the EU and develop the desired solution within a given time frame. Some tasks were handled by myself only and in other tasks I lead several members in a team. Working with EU clients was something new for me but I enjoyed every bit of it due to how friendly and experienced they were. Had to discontinue my association with the company early due to my University commitments in my graduation year.
